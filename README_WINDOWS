I. ABOUT THE APPLICATION
------------------------

This work was borns from the research of wifiresearchers reverse engineers
(wifiresearchers.wordpress.com). Overtime,  additional  support  has  been
added  by  other  reverse  engineers.  By  using  this  application, it is
possible to calculate  the default WPA   keys   used   by   the  supported
routers such as  Telecom  Italia  AGPF,  Fastweb Pirelli,  Fastweb Telsey,
Pirelli TeleTu/Tele 2 and Eircom Netopia.


II. INSTALL
-----------

On MS Windows you need a compiler in order to compile the source. You  can
use  gcc. Use the following steps to execute the sources compilation:

1 - Download gcc from http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net (please choose the correct
    version for your architecture)

2 - Install it

3 - Extract the wirouterkeyrec's zip archive into the gcc directory
    (default is C:\MinGW)

4 - Execute Makefile_windows.bat

Now you can see the executable: wirouterkeyrec.exe

ATTENTION: the agpf_config.lst file must always be in the  same  directory
where the executable is present


III. HOW TO USE
---------------

Using  this  application is very simple. The  simplest  way is to pass the
SSID(s) to the command line using the --ssid (-s) option:

wirouterkeyrec.exe -s Alice-xxxxxxxx,FASTWEB-x-xxxxxxxxxxxx


You can load the SSID(s) also from a file:

wirouterkeyrec.exe -f essid_list_file


Or from both file and command line:

wirouterkeyrec.exe -s Alice-xxxxxxxx -f essid_list_file


The specified file content layout must be the following:

Alice-xxxxxxxx
FASTWEB-x-xxxxxxxxxxxx
eircomxxxxxxxx
teletuxxxxxxx/MAC_ADDRESS (each byte separated by ":")


WiRouter KeyRec  will search the configuration file for AGPF routers first
of  all in the current directory and after  in the installation directory.
It  will  do  the  same  research for  the  TeleTu configuration file. The
default files are agpf_config.lst and teletu_config.lst. You  can  set  an
alternative agpf/teletu configuration file  using  the -c/-t option:

wirouterkeyrec -s Alice-xxxxxxxx -c config_file
wirouterkeyrec -s teletu/00:23:8E:E5:28:C8 -t config_file


You  can  obtain  more  information  using  the -d  and -v options.


IV. HOW TO CALCULATE YOUR OWN MAGIC NUMBERS
-------------------------------------------

You can calculate the Magic Numbers by knowing the SSID, the Serial Number
and the Mac Address of an AGPF router. The following is the correct syntax
to use:

wirouterkeyrec -m Alice-48230959/67903X0041857/00:23:8e:89:1f:ec


The parameters must be separated by a slash (/). You can load a list also
from a file:

wirouterkeyrec -l file_name


You can use three output options:

The default format (does not require a parameter).

-p: Printscreens the format used in the AGPF configuration file
-w: Writes   the  calculated  Magic   Numbers   directly   in   the  AGPF
    configuration file appendix

You can use the -w option using the file name specified by the -c option.


IV. HOW TO UPDATE THE AGPF CONFIGURATION FILE
---------------------------------------------

The  supported  router models are reported  in  the  magic  number's  list
file (default: agpf_config.lst/teletu_config.lst).  You can upgrade easily
your own list with information found on the internet.

The string format for each AGPF model is the following:

"MODEL,SERIAL_PART_ONE,K CONSTANT,Q CONSTANT"

Example: "93X,69101,13,92398366,AA2F3C";

93X      = All router models that begin with 93.
69101    = A part of the serial number.
13       = The K constant for this router's model.
92398366 = The Q constant for this router's model.
AA2F3C   = The first 3 bytes of the MAC Address Ethernet

You can replace the content of the  agpf_config.lst  to   update the magic
numbers's list.

The string format for each Pirelli TeleTu/Tele 2 model is the following:

WMAC FROM TO SN1 BASE INCR

Example: 00:1C:A2 DA:E6:56 DB:48:69 74601 DAD231 3

00:1C:A2 = The first three bytes of WiFi MAC Address
DA:E6:56 = Start range
DB:48:69 = End range
74601    = Serial number
DAD231   = Base
3        = Increment

You can replace the content of the teletu_config.lst  to  update the magic
numbers's list.

You can use the option -u to replace the content of the configuration file
with  the  page  specified  by the -a option:

wirouterkeyrec -a "http://www.foo.com/agpf_list.txt" -u
wirouterkeyrec -o "http://www.foo.com/teletu_list.txt" -u

You can use only the option -u to update the list from the default pages:

wirouterkeyrec -u
